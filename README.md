# Day 1 Recap - 02/15/2023

Started development today and made some great progress. Fully created the Page Header section and i’m half way completed with the Content section. For the content section, the content is added, but I am creating the components that align everything properly. For all the sections that are horizontally aligned, the code for those were completed today and everything works.

For tomorrow, I plan on finishing the Content section and starting and completing the footer. Once thats done, I can get started on the scroll animations and responsiveness. I’m thinking I start with responsiveness first to have all the breakpoints created before adding animations to components, however, this will depend on whether or not the animations change based on the screen size.

# Day 2 Recap - 02/16/2023

Today I styled another portion of the content sections, however, I didn’t complete it because I wasn’t too interested in working on the vertical sections. So instead, I started work on the footer. I gathered all the flag images needed for the drop down and started working on a plan for how I am going to tackle the footer. For the dropdown, I wasn’t able to just plop the images with the text in a select, so I am going to look into making a custom dropdown component to hopefully have more control over its styling and functionality. This should let me get it looking and working closer to the original.

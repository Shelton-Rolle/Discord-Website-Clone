# Day 1 Recap - 02/15/2023

Started development today and made some great progress. Fully created the Page Header section and i’m half way completed with the Content section. For the content section, the content is added, but I am creating the components that align everything properly. For all the sections that are horizontally aligned, the code for those were completed today and everything works.

For tomorrow, I plan on finishing the Content section and starting and completing the footer. Once thats done, I can get started on the scroll animations and responsiveness. I’m thinking I start with responsiveness first to have all the breakpoints created before adding animations to components, however, this will depend on whether or not the animations change based on the screen size.

# Day 2 Recap - 02/16/2023

Today I styled another portion of the content sections, however, I didn’t complete it because I wasn’t too interested in working on the vertical sections. So instead, I started work on the footer. I gathered all the flag images needed for the drop down and started working on a plan for how I am going to tackle the footer. For the dropdown, I wasn’t able to just plop the images with the text in a select, so I am going to look into making a custom dropdown component to hopefully have more control over its styling and functionality. This should let me get it looking and working closer to the original.

# Day 3 Recap - 02/17/2023

Today I completed the Footer component. I created the custom dropdown menu like I wanted, which was surprisingly easier than expected. Once that was created, it was pretty simple adding in the rest of the content. So far, the page isn’t an exact match, due to different fonts, however, it’s close enough where I’m happy with what I’m producing. The plan for tomorrow is to finally tackle the Vertical Section component and once thats done that’ll be a wrap on this project.

# Day 4 Recap - 02/17/2023

Today I finished up the last vertical section in the ContentSection which wrapped up what I had planned to complete when starting this project. All in all, it's not a perfect replication, due to some different fonts and trouble with the video call svg that I didn't understand, however, I'm happy with how it turned out.

# What would I add

I only planned to re-create the desktop view of this website, however, if I had some more time I think I would've liked trying to add responsiveness to this project. If possible, I also would've liked to have all the same fonts that the actual website used to get a much closer re-creation.

# What I learned

I learned a lot more about the "styled-components" library such as its themes and nesting as well as inheriting from other styled components. I am still new to it but I definitely know more now than I did before starting this project. I also realized how many different options there are when it comes to organizing your file system. I actual spent a good amount of time trying to decide how I wanted to organize all my components and styled components, and although I'm not mad at what I decided on, even after making my decisions I was realizing new and better ways I could've organized this project.
